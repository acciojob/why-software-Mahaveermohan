	 <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
        I have always been fascinated by technology and the endless possibilities it offers. 
        The ability to create software that solves real-world problems and enhances lives 
        motivates me every day. I enjoy the challenge of coding, the logic behind algorithms, 
        and the creativity involved in building applications. Becoming a developer allows me 
        to continuously learn, innovate, and contribute to a digital future.
